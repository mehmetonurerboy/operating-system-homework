Pre-emptive Shortest First Job Algorithm

In this situation, we know the number of processes. So, we increase CPU time one by one until all process enter the job queue and we scan the process queue list because of existing shorter process. (Because came process can have shorter time that execute itself. It causes a change on process at CPU.) After all process came to the queue, we serve the CPU to shortest process, so CPU time increases as shortest process time. This process go on until all processes are executed.
